  /*! @brief API that a code has to implement in order to comply with the ICoCo (version 2) norm.
   *
   * This abstract class represents the methods that a given code may implement to comply (partially or fully) to the
   * ICoCo standard. For organization and documentation purposes the interface is separated into several sections but
   * this does not correspond to any code constraint.
   * Note that not all the methods need to be implemented! Notably the methods belonging to the sections
   *   - Restorable
   *   - Field I/O
   *   - Scalar values I/O
   * are not always needed since a code might not have any integer field to work with for example.
   * Consequently, default implementation for all methods of this interface is to raise an ICoCo::NotImplemented
   * exception.
   *
   * Some of the methods may not be called when some conditions are not met (i.e. when not in the correct context). Thus
   * in this documentation we define the "TIME_STEP_DEFINED context" as the context that the code finds itself, when the method
   * initTimeStep() has been called, and the method validateTimeStep() (or abortTimeStep()) has not yet been called.
   * This is the status in which the current computation time step is well defined.
   *
   * Within the computation of a time step (so within TIME_STEP_DEFINED), the temporal semantic of the fields (and
   * scalar values) is not imposed by the norm. Said differently, it does not require the fields to be defined at the
   * start/middle/end of the current time step, this semantic must be agreed on between the codes being coupled.
   * Fields and scalar values that are set within the TIME_STEP_DEFINED context are invalidated (undefined behavior)  
   * after a call to validateTimeStep() (or abortTimeStep()). They need to be set at each time step. However, fields and scalar 
   * values that are set outside of this context (before the first time step for example, or after the resolution of the last 
   * time step) are permanent (unless modified afterward within the TIME_STEP_DEFINED context).
   *
   * Finally, the ICoCo interface may be wrapped in Python using SWIG or PyBind11. For an example of the former see the
   * TRUST implementation of ICoCo. Notably the old methods returning directly MEDCoupling::MEDCouplingFieldDouble objects
   * (version 1.x of ICoCo) are easily re-instanciated in Python SWIG.
